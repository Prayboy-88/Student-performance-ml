## ⚠️ Note on Data & Scalability

**Privacy Disclaimer:**
The analysis presented in this repository utilizes the public UCI Student Performance dataset (approx. 600 rows) as a **proxy** for demonstration purposes. 

The actual production pipeline referenced in my resume was deployed on a proprietary internal dataset containing **28,000+ student records**. Due to data privacy regulations (FERPA) and confidentiality agreements, the real-world dataset cannot be published here. This repository demonstrates the **identical feature engineering and modeling architecture** used in the larger scale implementation.
